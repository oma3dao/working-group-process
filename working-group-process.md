# OMA3 Working Group Process

## 1. Introduction

This document is meant to augment Article VI, Section 1 of the [OMA3 Association Organizational Regulations](https://www.oma3.org/organizational-regulations) and applies to working groups that have the charter to build a standard or infrastructure.  It describes the process a working group must go through to reach the best possible outcome.  For an overview of the process, read the [OMA3 blog](https://www.oma3.org/post/oma3-operations-and-governance) on governance.

## 2. Overview

Technical working groups follow these steps:

  * Create use cases
  * Identify threats
  * Vote on requirements
  * Solicit contributions for specifications
  * Write code or create a certification program.

## 3. Use Cases

### Purpose

The definition of use cases is an important and valuable step when capturing requirements. Use cases capture the main objectives of a system. A use case driven specification development process allows one to detect and analyze top-level building blocks of a system in order to identify the main actors and determine how such actors are going to interact with the system. An actor specifies a role played by an entity external to the system, that interacts with the system. 

A use case can be described as a list of actions which defines the interactions between an actor and the system in order to achieve a specific individual goal or execute a specific activity. A use case may include events, which describe an occurrence or a sudden change in the system’s status. Actors can be a human or an external system.

When creating a use case document, use cases and activities are described and analyzed for the following reasons:

  * To derive high-level technical and non-technical requirements.
  * To understand dependencies from external stakeholders and from the external environment.
  * To scope the technical architecture.
  * To describe the main activities.

### System

The System includes all aspects described in a specification or the infrastructure that provides the desired functionality.  It may include one or more blockchains, including validators and other servers, and smart contracts.  It could also include centralized servers run by OMA3.

### Actors

In UML an actor is a behavioral classifier which specifies a role played by an external entity that interacts with a system (e.g., by exchanging signals and data). The term "role" is used informally to group users that require specific services from the system, modeled within associated use cases. When an external entity interacts with the system, it plays the role of a specific actor. Such an entity may play several different roles. In turn, a specific role
may be played by one or more entities. Actors can be abstract or concrete, and you can establish a generalization relationship between them, e.g., teaching → profession.

## 4. Threats

Threats include actions that circumvent the system design, error cases, and edge cases.  Documenting threats leads to a more robust system design.  Understanding the threats can also build a more robust set of requirements.

## 5. Requirements

Requirements definitions are used to judge specification proposals that describe system implementations.  When writing requirement definitions, use the key words "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" as described in RFC 2119 ‎‎[1].

SHALL: This word means that the definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.

SHALL NOT means that the definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.

SHOULD: This word means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular definition, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course.

SHOULD NOT: This phrase means that there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before implementing any behavior described with this label.

MAY: This word means that a definition is truly optional. A specification may choose to fulfill the requirement because a particular marketplace requires it or because the specification feels that it enhances the product while another specification may omit the same item.

## 6. Solicit Proposals

Once a working group has finalized use cases, threats, and requirements it can begin to solicit solution proposals.  This is often done by releasing a Request for Proposals (RFP) that is available to the public.  Organizations that would like to submit a proposal must [join OMA3](https://www.oma3.org/join) and sign the [member agreement](https://assets-global.website-files.com/62a8cfee4d1b8a5209c0fd7b/6635371bd724c2480b01bdf4_oma3-complete-signable-v6.pdf).
